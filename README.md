# logbook
Small python script I use to write journals on a daily basis.

So far the only thing left to add so far are better searching and sorting functions. It is smarter to automatically organize the files by date rather than to search them on the script.

I could add later on the possibility to write your journals using a remote connection but it creates way more security issues and knowledge I currently don't have.
